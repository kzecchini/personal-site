## Hi!

I'm Kevin.

I started my data journy as a data scientist 8 years ago creating productized machine learning models in the healthcare and health adjacent spaces. These models span everything from back office churn/ltv models, to patient risk scores, to food recommendation systems. Many models I have implemented are still in use today! 

In the process of implementing these models for use in customer facing applications, I've become an expert in MLOps and production engineering. More recently, I have been a technical lead and people manager for all aspects of a modern data team - engineering, data science, machine learning, and data analytics - where I designed and implemented state of the art data infrastructure from scratch.  

I'm always focused on delivering an end to end product integrated with a company's core application. But more importantly, I build products that move the needle. Quantifying impact/KPIs of predictive analytics is in my opinion the most overlooked aspect of the industry. Developing and keeping machine learning/AI systems live is expensive and needs to be easily justifiable to business stakeholders. I make sure that you get value from your data.

In my free time I enjoy hiking, playing golf, playing competitive video games, playing guitar, and drawing.
